# Update check, end to end (Epic 86 T12).
#
# Runs the PACKAGED app, because electron-updater is inactive in an unpackaged
# one (`update-check-skip updater-inactive`) — so a dev-mode assertion would
# prove nothing about what ships.
#
#   A. a local HTTP server stands in for the feed. Assert the app asks for
#      `latest-dev-mac.yml` (the channel derived from the -dev version), that
#      the startup delay is 15 s + jitter, and that the version it is offered
#      matches the running one.
#   B. the same run against a closed port (the offline case). Assert a logged
#      failure, a retry scheduled, and an app that is still alive — an
#      unreachable feed must never be fatal.
#
# The feed is GitHub Releases (decided 2026-09-10). This smoke proves the client
# half against a local stand-in: scheduling, the channel file name, the -dev
# label, the offline path, and that the packaged config points at our repository.
# What it cannot prove is GitHub's own side — matching the channel against the
# tag's prerelease in `releases.atom`, which needs a really published release.
